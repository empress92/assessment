          <h2 class="h2">Our Vision/Mission Statement </h2>
            
           <p id="farmwing1">Farmwings recognizes the importance of capacity development in strengthening research for 
            development (R4D) through Tech. We support formal and informal
            training activities as part of our strategy to improve food security and reduce
            poverty in the region, through capacity development programs, indirectly 
            through knowledge our trained personels will in turn passed on to others. farmwings offers
            capacity development to international program partners to aid the improvement of research
            practices and general knowledge. The overall goal of our training activities is to strengthen 
            the capability of partners in the national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES). 
            Our training activities facilitate research collaboration between farmwings and the NARES,
            ultimately allowing those involved to conduct research in their own regions.

        <p> <h2 class="h2">Why Africa</h2>
                        The continent is bursting with potential; almost 200 million hectares, 
                        sub-Saharan Africa is home to nearly half of the world’s uncultivated land that can 
                        be brought into production. Africa uses only 2 percent of its renewable water resources
                        compared to 5 percent globally. Together with abundant resources, including a resourceful,
                        enterprising youth population, strategic investments in agriculture can unleash virtuous growth cycles. 
                        How can Africa, then, capitalize on these opportunities?
            <h2 class="h2">Way Forward</h2>         
                        African farmers need new technology, higher-yielding, more resilient food crops 
                        that deliver bountiful harvests. New techniques are beginning to boost yields in rice and 
                        cocoa, among other crops. African farmers need more ICT , more irrigation, and better
                        infrastructure that links them to lucrative regional food markets. We need sound policies that
                        do not discriminate against the farm sector. Women produce the bulk of food in Africa, and yet they are 
                        largely locked out of land ownership, access to credit, and productive farm inputs such as fertilizers, 
                        pesticides, and farming tools.
                        Further, they are often bypassed by extension services, limiting their productivity. </p>

                <h2 class="h2">Aquaponics</h2>
                
                        FWi has adapted an innovative food production technique known as aquaponics 
                        into a simple, scalable and low-cost system that can provide year-round sustainable 
                        produce and fish for families, small-scale farmers, communities, schools, businesses
                        and government institutions. Using inexpensive and easily accessible “off the shelf” local materials, FWi
                        aquaponics combines aquaculture (fish farming) with hydroponics (soilless crop production) into
                        a closed system that is resilient to erratic and destructive climate change events. Aquaponics is 
                        10 times more productive than equivalently sized plots that are traditionally cultivated, requires no
                        pesticides or fertilizers and consumes 
                        up to 90% less water than traditional irrigation techniques.
